The shell files for each subquestion are separate. For example, I have named the shell file for question 1 subpart a as `Q1a.sh'. I have saved the subquestions for Q1 and Q5 separately. I have saved Q3 in a single shell file though, as mentioned in the question.
For Q3, we have to pass the file to be read as an argument while executing the shell script, as in `./Q3.sh filename.txt'.
